# JSmartContract
This is a simple smart contract over a custom block chain to help everyone understand them.

This smart contract runs JavaScript using Mozilla Rhino: https://github.com/mozilla/rhino
This project also includes JSON, make sure to add the library for that as well.

I left some comments on the main class, the rest has little to no comments, however
it should be easy to implement anything you want.

This code has no licenses, however I don't know about Rhino, so you might want to check that.
