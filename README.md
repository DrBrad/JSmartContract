# JSmartContract
This is a simple smart contract over a custom block chain to help everyone understand them.<br><br>

This smart contract runs JavaScript using Mozilla Rhino: https://github.com/mozilla/rhino
This project also includes JSON, make sure to add the library for that as well.<br><br>

I left some comments on the main class, the rest has little to no comments, however
it should be easy to implement anything you want.<br><br>
